# ProjectiveSymm-TB

This is a mathematica code for constructing tigh-binding model with any order of hoppings from projectively enriched space group symmetries. The code is acompanied with [MagneticTB](https://github.com/zhangzeyingvv/MagneticTB). 
The current version is able to deal with P2 and Ci group, which correpsonds to non-centered inversion in 2D and 3D. Version to deal with more complex space groups with k-dependent symmetry representations is under development.
