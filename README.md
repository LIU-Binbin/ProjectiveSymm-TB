# ProjectiveSymm-TB

This is a mathematica code for constructing tigh-binding model from projectively enriched space group symmetries.
The current version is able to deal with P2 and Ci group, which correpsonds to non-centered inversion in 2D and 3D. Version with more complex space groups with k-dependent symmetry representations is under development.
