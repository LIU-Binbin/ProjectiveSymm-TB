# ProjectiveSymm-TB

This is a Mathematica code for constructing tight-binding model with any order of hoppings from projectively enriched space group symmetries. The code is acompanied with [MagneticTB](https://github.com/zhangzeyingvv/MagneticTB). The current notebook set an example to deal with P2 and Ci group, which have non-centered inversion symmetries in 2D and 3D. Version to deal with more sophisticated space groups with k-dependent symmetry representations is under development.
